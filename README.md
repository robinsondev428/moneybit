# How to use

First, install the cli via npm:

    npm i -g moneybit

This installs `mb` command.

Then run:

    mb ledger journal.yml --chart chart.yml

This outputs the general ledger in yaml format to stdout according to the given yaml files `journal.yml` and `chart.yml`. See the below for details.

# Journal YAML

The journal is the series of trades in chronological order. Each trade should have the following format

```yml
id: 1001
date: 2015-01-05
desc: Start the business
dr:
  Cash in bank: 1000
cr:
  Capital: 1000
```

- `id` is an arbitrary string and has to be unique in the journal.
- `date` is the date of the trade.
- `desc` is the description of the trade.
- `dr` means the debits of the trade.
  - `dr` has at least one account. In this case, it has `Cash in bank` account with the amount `1000`.
  - `dr` can have multiple accounts.
- `cr` means the credits of the trade.
  - `cr` has at least one account. In this case, it has `Capital` account with the amount `1000`.
  - `cr` can have multiple accounts.
- The total amount of the credits and debits must be the same in a account.

Multiple entry journal looks like the following:

```yml
id: 1
date: 2015-01-05
desc: Start the business
dr:
  Cash in bank: 1000
cr:
  Capital: 1000
---
id: 2
date: 2015-01-30
desc: Sold the item
dr:
  Cash in bank: 1000
cr:
  Sales: 1000
---
...
```

Each document in a yaml represents a trade.

# Chart YAML

This file defines which account belongs to which major account type. For example, the account `Sales` belongs `Revenue`, `Cash` belongs to `Asset` etc.

The format is like the following:

```yml
asset:
- Account receivable
- Cash in deposit
liability:
- Account payable
equity:
- Capital
revenue:
- Sales
expense:
- Freight
- Communications
- Business trip
- Library cost
```

# Ledger YAML

This is the output of this cli and represents the general ledger. The accounts in the input journal are collected by its account type and its major type. It has the following format.

```yml
asset:
  Cash in bank:
    total: 1050
    accounts:
      - date: 2015-01-01
        desc: Start the business
        dr: 1000
        cor: Capital
        ref: 1001
liability: ...
equity: ...
revenue: ...
expense: ...
```
